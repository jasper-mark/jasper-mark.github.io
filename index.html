        <p>
          I hold a bachelor's in Exercise and Sport Science from The University of North Carolina at
          Chapel Hill, NC and a Ph.D. in Human Movement Science focusing on computational
          neuroscience techniques and neuromotor control from The University of North Carolina at
          Chapel Hill School of Medicine, NC.

        <p>
          The focus of my research is to develop computational methods for modeling nonstationary
          dynamics in complex systems and relating those dynamics to human behavior and clinical
          outcomes.

            <h3>Characterizing Hierarchical Dependencies in Time-Series Networks</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a quantitative framework for characterizing how hierarchical dependencies
              emerge and reorganize in large-scale, interacting networks following perturbation.
              Using multimodal time-series data, I apply network-based, coherence, and cross-frequency
              methods to quantify how slow, higher-order dynamics modulate faster subsystem activity
              across space and time. This approach captures hierarchical control processes that are
              invisible to static connectivity or single-scale analyses.
            </p>
            <p>
              A central contribution of this work is the development of phase-modulated
              corticomuscular coherence (pmCMC), a novel metric that integrates network-level
              connectivity with time-resolved coordination. Applied to longitudinal datasets, pmCMC
              distinguishes adaptive versus maladaptive reorganization and selectively relates to
              system-level performance outcomes. More broadly, this project focuses on building
              mechanistically interpretable biomarkers that describe nonstationary dynamics in complex
              systems rather than treating connectivity as static or homogeneous.

            <h3>A Dual-State Recurrent Model for Nonstationary Sequences</h3>
            <p>
              I designed a novel recurrent neural network architecture to address a fundamental
              limitation of standard sequence models: the entanglement of short- and long-horizon
              dependencies within a single memory state. Many real-world time-series exhibit mixed
              temporal structure, where fast transients coexist with slow, drifting baselines—conditions
              under which conventional LSTMs often struggle.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Truncated–Shuffled Dual-State LSTM (RS-D LSTM) explicitly separates memory into
              short-term and long-term states, each governed by independent learnable time constants.
              This design allows the model to allocate representational capacity across timescales on
              a per-dimension basis. In direct comparisons with parameter-matched LSTMs on large-scale
              EEG datasets, the RS-D LSTM achieved substantial gains in predictive performance across
              multiple classification tasks. Beyond accuracy, the architecture exposes interpretable
              parameters that reveal how information is retained across timescales, bridging predictive
              modeling with insight into underlying signal structure.

            <h3>Closed-Loop Learning from Intrinsic Signals</h3>
            <p>
              I am leading a real-time study that treats functional connectivity itself as a learnable
              control signal, using operant conditioning to enhance corticomuscular coherence (CMC)
              through biofeedback. The system integrates high-density EEG and EMG with low-latency
              signal processing to compute beta-band CMC online during a precision motor task,
              enabling trial-by-trial feedback based on instantaneous network coupling rather than
              behavior alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants receive adaptive feedback and rewards contingent on increases in
              connectivity relative to a dynamic baseline, allowing intrinsic neural signals to drive
              learning in a closed-loop setting. To validate the physiological relevance of
              conditioning-induced changes, biofeedback is paired with pre/post transcranial magnetic
              stimulation to assess changes in corticospinal excitability. This project provides a
              general framework for online inference, feedback, and control in noisy, nonstationary
              systems, where learning emerges from internal dynamics rather than external supervision.

            <h3>Interpretable Learning Under Low-Dimensional Resource Constraints</h3>
            <p>
              I developed an interpretable machine-learning system that maps four-channel surface EMG
              to American Sign Language gestures under strict sensing and computational constraints.
              Rather than relying on high-dimensional representations or deep architectures, this work
              emphasizes physiologically grounded feature engineering and support vector machine (SVM)
              classifiers to achieve robust performance across users and sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project highlights a complementary modeling philosophy: when data are sparse and
              resources are limited, carefully designed features and classical models can outperform
              more complex approaches. The system prioritizes interpretability, robustness, and
              deployability, illustrating how meaningful structure can be extracted from
              low-dimensional signals without sacrificing performance. It reflects my broader
              interest in constraint-aware learning, where modeling choices are shaped by real-world
              limitations rather than idealized assumptions.

            <h3>Learning Robust Representations for Real-Time Speech Enhancement</h3>
            <p class="project-subtitle">Low-Latency Deep Learning for Noisy Audio</p>
            <p>
              I developed a machine-learning pipeline for real-time speech enhancement designed to
              operate under the strict latency and computational constraints required for mobile and
              assistive hearing technologies. The system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
              map noisy speech spectrograms to cleaned representations, improving intelligibility
              while remaining lightweight enough for real-time deployment on resource-limited devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The model was trained on paired clean and noisy speech generated by mixing the ARU
              Speech Corpus with diverse real-world noise environments (e.g., traffic, machinery, and
              babble). Inputs consisted of short-time spectrogram and mel-frequency features spanning
              a small temporal context, enabling the network to denoise speech with minimal buffering
              and low algorithmic delay. Performance was evaluated using perceptual and signal-based
              metrics, including PESQ, log spectral distance (LSD), and segmental SNR, demonstrating
              consistent improvements across noise conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key emphasis of this project was constraint-aware model design: prioritizing simple
              architectures, low-latency inference, and robustness over depth or parameter count. The
              resulting system illustrates how carefully structured deep learning models can achieve
              meaningful gains in signal quality while remaining suitable for embedded or smartphone-
              based applications.
